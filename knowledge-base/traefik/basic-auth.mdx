The configuration is slightly different for [`Standard Applications`](#standard-applications) and [`Docker Compose based applications/one-click services`](#docker-compose-based-applications-and-one-click-services).

All that is needed is to set custom labels on the Coolify application.

## Standard Applications

```bash
traefik.http.middlewares.<random_unique_name>.basicauth.users=test:$2y$12$ci.4U63YX83CwkyUrjqxAucnmi2xXOIlEF6T/KdP9824f1Rf1iyNG
traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.middlewares=<random_unique_name>
```

In the example above, we are using `test` as username and `test` as password.

<Tip>
  You most likely have a `traefik.http.middlewares` label already set. In that case, you must append the `<random_unique_name>` middleware to the existing value.
  For example:

  ```bash
  traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.middlewares=gzip,<random_unique_name>
    ```
</Tip>

Note: The `<random_unique_name>` and `<unique_router_name>` are placeholders. You need to replace them when you add them to your own labels section.
The `<random_unique_name>` is a unique name for the middleware and you need to make that up yourself. The `<unique_router_name>`
is the unique name for the router that Coolify has already generated for you.

### An ngnix Simple Web Container Example

Let's say you have an ngnix simple web container that was generated by Coolify with the following Dockerfile:
```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
```

The  `Container Labels` generated by Coolify would look like this:

```bash
traefik.enable=true
traefik.http.middlewares.gzip.compress=true
traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-https.redirectscheme.scheme=https
traefik.http.routers.http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.entryPoints=http
traefik.http.routers.http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.middlewares=redirect-to-https
traefik.http.routers.http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.rule=Host(`ngnixsite.mysite.com`) && PathPrefix(`/`)
traefik.http.routers.http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.service=http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8
traefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.entryPoints=https
traefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.middlewares=gzip
traefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.rule=Host(`ngnixsite.mysite.com`) && PathPrefix(`/`)
traefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.service=https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8
traefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt
traefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.tls=true
traefik.http.services.http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.loadbalancer.server.port=80
traefik.http.services.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.loadbalancer.server.port=80
caddy_0.encode=zstd gzip
caddy_0.handle_path.0_reverse_proxy={{upstreams 80}}
caddy_0.handle_path=/*
caddy_0.header=-Server
caddy_0.try_files={path} /index.html /index.php
caddy_0=https://ngnixsite.73rdst.com
caddy_ingress_network=coolify
```

If you want to add basic authentication to this service, assuming you want to name your auth middleware `mybasicauth`, you could add the following label below the
first line `traefik.enable=true`:

`traefik.http.middlewares.mybasicauth.basicauth.users=test:$2y$12$ci.4U63YX83CwkyUrjqxAucnmi2xXOIlEF6T/KdP9824f1Rf1iyNG`

Notice that `mybasicauth` has replaced the `<random_unique_name>` placeholder. In other words, you have named your own auth middleware `mybasicauth`.

Then you need to add the middleware to the router label, and since one or more middlewares are already set, you need to append the new middleware to the existing value.

For example you would update the current line

`traefik.http.routers.http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.middlewares=redirect-to-https`

to:

`traefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.middlewares=gzip,mybasicauth`

Notice that in this case `<unique_router_name>` has been replaced with `https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8` which is the unique name for the router that Coolify has already generated for you.

Your `ngnix` simple web container is protected by basic authentication.

## Docker Compose based Applications & one-click Services

To add `basicauth` middleware to your service, you need to add the following labels to your `docker-compose.yml` file.:

```yaml
services:
  ngnix-simple-web-container::
    image: 'nginx:alpine'
    ports:
      - '8080:80'
    labels:
      - 'traefik.http.middlewares.<random_unique_name>.basicauth.users=test:$2y$12$ci.4U63YX83CwkyUrjqxAucnmi2xXOIlEF6T/KdP9824f1Rf1iyNG'
```

You should replace the placeholders `<random_unique_name>` with a unique name for the middleware. For example, you might name it `mybasicauth`, and then
replace the placeholder with `mybasicauth`. That label would then look like this:

```
    labels:
      - 'traefik.http.middlewares.mybasicauth.basicauth.users=test:$2y$12$ci.4U63YX83CwkyUrjqxAucnmi2xXOIlEF6T/KdP9824f1Rf1iyNG'
```

We have now added `basicauth` middleware to the `nginx-simple-web-container` service.

Your `ngnix` simple web container is protected by basic authentication with a username of test and password of test.

Note: When applying basic authentication labels, special characters like $, @, and , must be escaped to avoid parsing errors.
That is for example, enclose the label values in quotes and use a backslash (\) before special characters if you're using double quotes.

## How to generate user/password?

You need to set your username and password in the `basicauth.users` label.

You can generate one with the [htpasswd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html) command:

```bash
htpasswd -nbB test test
```

This will generate a password hash for the user `test` with the password `test`.
You can then replace `test` with the desired username and password. Then substitute the generated hash in the `basicauth.users` label above.

Note: the `htpasswd` command is available on most Linux distributions. It is part of the `apache2-utils` package on Debian/Ubuntu and
can be found [here](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html).
